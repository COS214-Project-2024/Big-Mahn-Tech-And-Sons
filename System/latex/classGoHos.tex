Executes the command to move the citizen to the specified destination. 

The function retrieves the citizen\textquotesingle{}s current position and checks if the destination has already been reached. If not, it uses the transport strategy to move the citizen along a path found in the road network. If no path is available, a message is displayed.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
destination\+Node is set in the constructors of the relevant command. 
\end{DoxyNote}
\begin{DoxyAttention}{Attention}
Citizens must have a catalog of addresses, such as Work, Home, and random Entertainment then find\+Path will do the rest. 
\end{DoxyAttention}


Implements \mbox{\hyperlink{classGoToCommand_af1f26d8202f09a43a257163c86042747}{Go\+To\+Command}}.
