\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Defines the \mbox{\hyperlink{classEventsCommand}{Events\+Command}} interface that provides virtual methods for various event-\/related actions. 

This file declares an abstract base class {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classEventsCommand}{Events\+Command}}} which serves as an interface for handling different events such as pandemics, natural disasters, load-\/shedding, festivals, and economic recessions. Each type of event includes various commands that can be implemented in concrete classes.
