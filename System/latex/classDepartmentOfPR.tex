\item It observes buildings and citizens to monitor their state. If issues are detected, it takes necessary actions.
\item For example, if a building is overpopulated, it can notify the housing department to plan more buildings.
\end{DoxyItemize}

2. {\bfseries{Mediator Pattern}}\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item It acts as a mediator by coordinating communication between departments such as Housing, Utilities, and Finance.
\item This helps in streamlining requests, ensuring that departments do not need to communicate directly with each other but rather through this central hub.
